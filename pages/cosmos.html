                The cosmos is another name for the universe. Using the word cosmos implies
                viewing the universe as a complex and orderly system or entity.

                The cosmos, and understandings of the reasons for its existence and significance, are studied in
                cosmology -
                a broad discipline covering scientific, religious or philosophical aspects of the cosmos and its nature.
                Religious and philosophical approaches may include the cosmos among spiritual entities or other matters
                deemed to exist outside the physical universe.

                The verb κοσμεῖν (κοσμεῖν) meant generally "to dispose, prepare", but especially "to order and arrange
                (troops for battle), to set (an army) in array"; also "to establish (a government or regime)", "to
                adorn, dress" (especially of women). Thus kosmos meant "ornaments, decoration" (compare kosmokomes
                "dressing the hair," and cosmetic). The philosopher Pythagoras used the term kosmos (Ancient Greek:
                κόσμος, Latinized kósmos) for the order of the universe. Anaxagoras further introduced the concept of
                a Cosmic Mind (Nous) ordering all things. The modern Greek κόσμος "order, good order, orderly
                arrangement" is a word with several main senses rooted in those notions. κόσμος has developed, along
                with primary "the universe, the world", the meaning of "people" (collectively).

            <h2>European view</h2>
            <p>
                Stars rotating in the night sky
                Early Europeans viewed the cosmos as a divinely created, spatially finite, bifurcated cosmos, divided
                into sublunary and superlunary realms. Objects above the lunar disc were believed to be stable, with
                heavenly bodies believed to be made out of a refined substance called "quintessence". This was
                understood to be a crystalline, completely transparent substance that held all of the superlunary
                spheres in perfect order. After their creation by God, these spheres did not change except for their
                rotation above the Earth. Objects below the lunar sphere were subject to constant combination,
                separation, and recombination. This was because they consisted of the chaotic elements of earth, air,
                fire, and water.</p>

            <h2>Chinese view</h2>
            <p>The Chinese had multiple theories of the processes and components of the cosmos. The most popular
                of these beliefs was the Xuan Ye theory, the astronomical view of the cosmos as an infinite space with
                floating pieces of condensed vapor. The Chinese believed that the Earth consisted of condensed yin
                and the heavens of yang; and that these properties coexisted in constant relation to each other, with
                yin and yang being used together to explain processes on Earth as well of those relating the Earth in
                conjunction with the heavens. This idea was described by Joseph Needham as a cosmos that functioned
                similarly to a complex organism, with discernible patterns in an ever-changing structure. There was both
                a pattern and a randomness to the cosmos. Because of this, the Chinese believed that earthly
                phenomena could affect heavenly bodies.</p>

            <h2>Indian view</h2>
            <p>The Indians believed in a cyclic universe and is related to three other beliefs: time is
                endless and space has infinite extension; , earth is not the center of the universe; and , laws
                govern all development, including the creation and destruction of the universe. The Indians believed
                that there were three types of space, physiological, physical, and infinite space. The infinite space is
                conducted of undivided consciousness and everything that consist inside and outside. However, finite
                division of space is where time begins and the division of time is where all beings were first created.
                It was believed that there are connections between the physical and the psychological worlds, and an
                equivalence existed between the outer cosmos and the inner cosmos of the individual. This is expressed
                in the famous sentence - yat pinḍe tad brahmṇḍe, “as in the body so in the universe”.</p>

            <h2>Australian view</h2>
            <p>Australian cosmology beliefs were based around the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's ideas,
                also known as Indigenous astronomy, and it was around before the Babylonians, Greeks, and the
                Renaissance period. They found ways to observe the moon, stars, and the sun, this enabled them to create
                a sense of time. This also allowed them to navigate across the continent, create calendars, and predict
                the weather. One of the most important constellations in Australia for the Aboriginal people is the Emu.
                The Emu constellation represents the connection between the earth and the sky, you can see stories and
                representations of their constellations written on some cave walls in Australia. Another indigenous
                tribe known as the Euahlayi saw the Milky Way as a river and between the two bright sides represented a
                Galactic Bulge where the two sons of the creator Baiame and the river made a connection from the earth
                and the sky. The Yolngu people were one of the first to discover how the tide of the ocean works. They
                discovered the tide had a direct correlation with the moon. Their reasoning as to why the ocean did not
                fill up as much as perhaps when the moon was full versus a crescent moon is because the moon was not as
                full either. This contradicts the father of science, Galileo, who said that the tides correlated with
                the earth's orbit around the sun. Multiple indigenous tribes described winter by the seven sisters, a
                group of stars in the sky that provided hunter-gatherers a sort of calendar to indicate whether they
                should be hunting or gathering, based on the season.</p>
