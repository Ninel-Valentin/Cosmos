            <p>
                Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System. It is a
                terrestrial planet with a heavily cratered surface due to the planet having no geological activity and
                an extremely tenuous atmosphere (called an exosphere). Despite being the smallest planet in the Solar
                System with a mean diameter of 4,880 km (3,030 mi), 38% of that of Earth's, Mercury is dense enough to
                have roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. Mercury has a dynamic magnetic field with a strength
                about 1% of that of Earth's and has no natural satellites.
                <br>
                <br>
                According to current theories, Mercury may have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid
                outer core, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. Having almost no atmosphere to retain
                heat, Mercury has surface temperatures that change wildly during the day, ranging from 100 K (-173 °C;
                -280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during sunlight across the equator regions. At Mercury's
                poles though, there are large reservoirs of water ices that are never exposed to direct sunlight, which
                has an estimated mass of about 0.025-0.25% the Antarctic ice sheet. There are many competing
                hypothesis about Mercury's origins and development, some of which incorporate collision with
                planetesimal and rock vaporization.
                <br>
                <br>
                Because Mercury is very close to the Sun, the intensity of sunlight on its surface is between 4.59 and
                10.61 times the solar constant (amount of the Sun's energy received at 1 astronomical unit, which is
                roughly the distance between Earth and the Sun). Mercury orbits the Sun in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance,
                meaning that relative to the background stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two
                revolutions it makes around the Sun. Counterintuitively, due to Mercury's slow rotation, an
                observer on the planet would see only one Mercurian solar day (176 Earth days) every two Mercurian solar
                years (88 Earth days each). Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets
                (about 1⁄30 of a degree), and its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar
                System.
                <br>
                <br>
                Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit, making it appear in Earth's sky only as a
                "morning star" or "evening star" that's relatively close to the Sun. In English, it is named after the
                Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, communication and the messenger of gods. Mercury is the
                most difficult planet to reach from Earth because it requires the greatest change in spacecraft's
                velocity. Only two spacecraft have visited Mercury as of 2023: Mariner 10 flew by in 1974 and 1975, and
                MESSENGER launched in 2004 and orbited Mercury over 4,000 times in four years. The BepiColombo
                spacecraft is planned to arrive at Mercury in 2025.

                Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet with a mass and size narrowly second in
                the Solar System to Earth, and with an atmosphere, which is the thickest of all four rocky planets of
                the Solar System and substantially thicker than Earth's. Its orbit is the next closest to Earth's,
                orbiting the Sun inferior inside of Earth's orbit, appearing (like Mercury) in Earth's sky always close
                to the Sun as either a "morning star" or "evening star". In Earth's sky it is also the natural object
                with the third highest maximum apparent brightness, after the Sun and the Moon, due to its proximity to
                Earth and the Sun, its size, and its highly reflective global cloud cover. Because of these
                prominent appearances in Earth's sky, Venus has been, particularly among the other four star-like
                classical planets, a common and important object for humans, in their cultures and astronomy.
                <br>
                <br>
                Venus retains, despite having only a weak induced magnetosphere, an especially thick atmosphere of
                mainly carbon dioxide, creating an extreme greenhouse effect together with its global sulfuric acid
                cloud cover. Because of this, the atmosphere reaches at its bottom a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C;
                867 °F) and a crushing pressure of 92 times that of Earth's at sea level, turning the air into a
                supercritical fluid, though at cloudy altitudes of 50 km (30 mi) Earth like levels are found. Conditions
                possibly favourable for life on Venus have been identified at its cloud layers, while recent research
                has found indicative, but not convincing evidence. Early in Venus' history water might have been
                abundant enough to form oceans, before it probably evaporated when greenhouse effects cascaded and then
                was taken away into space by the solar wind. Internally Venus is thought to consist of a
                core, mantle, and crust, the latter releasing internal heat through its active volcanism, shapeing the
                surface with large resurfacing instead of plate tectonics.

                Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place known in the universe where life has
                originated and found habitability. While Earth may not contain the largest volumes of water in the Solar
                System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water, extending over 70.8% of the planet with its ocean,
                making it an ocean world. The polar regions currently retain most of all other water with large sheets
                of ice covering ocean and land, dwarfing Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water. The
                other 29.2% of the Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands, and is widely covered
                by vegetation. Below the planet's surface lies the crust, consisting of several slowly moving tectonic
                plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Inside the Earth's crust
                is a liquid outer core that generates the magnetosphere, deflecting most of the destructive solar winds
                and cosmic radiation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most
                meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is
                widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as
                a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon
                dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the
                capturing of energy from the Sun's light. This process maintains the current average surface temperature
                of 14.76 °C, at which water is liquid under atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount of captured
                energy between geographic regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more sunlight than the polar
                regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a global climate system with different climate
                regions, and a range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such as nitrogen to
                cycle.

                Mars is the fourth planet and the furthest terrestrial planet from the Sun. The reddish color of its
                surface is due to finely grained iron(III) oxide dust in the soil, giving it the nickname "the Red
                Planet". There is a sharp contrast between the two Martian hemispheres: the northern hemisphere
                is on average flatter and smoother than the southern hemisphere. The planet's two poles are covered by
                water and carbon dioxide ice caps. Surrounding the Martian surface is a dynamic thin atmosphere (1% of
                Earth's surface pressure), made primarily of carbon dioxide. Mars has two irregularly shaped natural
                satellites, Phobos and Deimos.
                <br>
                <br>
                Mars has a mean radius of 3,389.5 km (2,106 mi), the second smallest among planets in the Solar System.
                The gravity on its surface is about 3.72 m/s2 (12.2 ft/s2), which is 38% of Earth's. The temperature on
                the Martian surface usually ranges from -110 °C (-166 °F) to 35 °C (95 °F). Geologically, Mars is fairly
                active, with dust devils sweeping the landscape and marsquakes trembling in the ground, a Martian analog
                to earthquakes. The surface of Mars also hosts the highest mountain (Olympus Mons) and one of the
                largest canyons in the Solar System (Valles Marineris). Days and seasons on Mars are comparable to those
                of Earth, with a day length of 24.5 hours, a year length of 1.88 Earth years, and an axial tilt only
                slightly greater than Earth's.
                <br>
                <br>
                Like the other planets, Mars was formed 4.5 billion years ago. The internal structure of Mars is thought
                to be composed of an outer crust, a mantle made of silicates, and an inner liquid core. During the
                Noachian period from about 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago, Mars's surface was marked by meteor impacts,
                valley formation, erosion, and the possible presence of water oceans. The Hesperian period from 3.7 to
                3.2-2 billion years ago was dominated by widespread volcanic activity and flooding that carved immense
                outflow channels. The Amazonian period, which continues today, was marked by the wind's influence on
                geological processes. It is not yet known whether life has ever existed on Mars.

                Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a
                mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and
                slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object
                in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It
                was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.
                <br>
                <br>
                Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen (90% by volume), followed by helium, which constitutes a
                quarter of its mass and a tenth of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates
                more heat than the planet receives from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation rate of 1 rotation per 10
                hours, the planet's shape is an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the
                equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms
                along their interacting boundaries. The most obvious result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm
                which has been observed since 1831 and possibly earlier.
                <br>
                <br>
                Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere, the largest
                contiguous structure in the Solar System after the heliosphere. Jupiter forms a system of 95 known moons
                and probably many more, including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io,
                Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury.
                Callisto is the second largest; Io and Europa are approximately the size of Earth's Moon.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since 1973, Jupiter has been visited by nine robotic probes: seven flybys and two dedicated orbiters,
                with two more either en route or awaiting launch.

                Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and has an intricate ring system. It is the second-largest
                planet
                in the Solar System and the second most massive planet in the Solar System, at 95 times the Earth's
                mass. With 96% of the planet is made out of lightweight hydrogen, Saturn is also the least dense planet
                in the Solar System. The planet's yellowish atmosphere is composed of intricate but usually
                bland-looking bands. Occasionally, oval-shaped storms would trail across Saturn's atmosphere; the
                biggest of which are the periodic Great White Spots. Its north pole contains a persisting hexagonal
                storm that currently does not have a definite explanation for its existence. Saturn has a magnetosphere
                with a strength comparable to Earth's and is the reason for the auroras in its outer atmosphere.
                <br>
                <br>
                Saturn is classified as a gas giant. It is thought to have a rocky core (with a temperature of 11,700 °C
                or 21,100 °F) surrounded by metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and helium, and
                a gaseous outer atmosphere. Inside the atmosphere are stacked cloud layers, made out of ammonia, water,
                and ammonium hydrosulfide ice. In terms of its motion in the Solar System, Saturn rotates once around
                its axis in around 10.5 hours and orbits one time around the Sun in 29.5 Earth years. The planet
                rotates fast that the planet bulges: its radius around the equator is 60,268 km (37,449 mi) is about 10%
                more than around the poles at 54,364 km (33,780 mi).
                <br>
                <br>
                The rings around Saturn is mostly made out of water ice particles, peppered with carbon and tholins.
                Compared to Saturn's age of around 4.5 billion years, these rings are thought to be relatively new and
                formed around 10-100 million years ago. Some of the gaps in Saturn's rings are caused by its shepherd
                moons, some are due to the larger outer moons destabilizing the rings structure, and a few are still
                unexplained. As of May 2023, Saturn has 145 known moons; the largest of these moons is Titan, which also
                has a dense hazy atmosphere.

                Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is a gaseous cyan ice giant. Most of Uranus is made out of
                water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is called 'ice' or
                volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum
                temperature of 49 K (-224 °C; -371 °F) out of all Solar System's planets. Uranus has a marked axial tilt
                of 97.8° with a retrograde rotation rate of 17 hours. This means that in an 84 Earth years orbital
                period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of
                continuous darkness
                <br>
                <br>
                Uranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass among the Solar System's planets. Based on
                current models, inside Uranus's volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and surrounding it is a thick
                hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Trace amount of hydrocarbons (thought to be produced via hydrolysis) and
                carbon monoxide along with carbon dioxide (thought to have been originated from comets) have been
                detected in the upper atmosphere. There are many unexplained climate phenomena in Uranus's atmosphere,
                such as its peak wind speed of 900 km/h (560 mph), variations in its polar cap and its erratic cloud
                formation. Uranus also has a very low internal heat compared to other giant planets, which is still
                unexplained.
                <br>
                <br>
                Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, orbiting natural satellites and a magnetosphere.
                Uranus's ring system is extremely dark, with only about 2% of the incoming light is reflected, and
                contains the known 13 inner moons. Further out are the larger 5 major moons of the planet: Miranda,
                Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon; and orbit at much greater distance from Uranus are the known 9
                irregular moons. Uranus magnetosphere is highly asymmetric and has many charged particles, which may
                cause the darkening of its rings and moons.

                Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known planet in the Solar System. It is the
                fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest
                giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.
                Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational
                compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined
                solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1
                astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the
                sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, representing Neptune's trident.
                <br>
                <br>
                Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by
                mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus
                led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown
                planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations,
                independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a
                telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le
                Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's
                remaining 14 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from
                Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes.
                Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the
                only spacecraft to have visited Neptune. The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large
                ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations
                from afar.

                Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies
                beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly
                orbit the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume, by a small margin, but is
                slightly less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock
                and is much smaller than the inner planets. Pluto has only one sixth the mass of Earth's moon, and one
                third its volume.

                Pluto has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit, ranging from 30 to 49 astronomical units (4.5 to
                7.3 billion kilometers; 2.8 to 4.6 billion miles) from the Sun. Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to
                reach Pluto at its orbital distance of 39.5 AU (5.91 billion km; 3.67 billion mi). Pluto's eccentric
                orbit periodically brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance prevents
                them from colliding.

                Pluto has five known moons: Charon, the largest, whose diameter is just over half that of Pluto; Styx;
                Nix; Kerberos; and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the
                barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body, and they are tidally locked. The New
                Horizons mission was the first spacecraft to visit Pluto and its moons, making a flyby on July 14, 2015
                and taking detailed measurements and observations.

                Pluto was discovered in 1930, the first object in the Kuiper belt. It was immediately hailed as the
                ninth planet, but it was always the odd object out,: 27 and its planetary status was questioned
                when it was found to be much smaller than expected. These doubts increased following the discovery of
                additional objects in the Kuiper belt starting in the 1990s, and particularly the more massive scattered
                disk object Eris in 2005. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally redefined the
                term planet to exclude dwarf planets such as Pluto. Many planetary astronomers, however, continue to
                consider Pluto and other dwarf planets to be planets.
